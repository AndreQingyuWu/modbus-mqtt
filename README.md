# modbus_mqtt
Python implementation of Modbus TCP + MQTT. Data can be read/written from remote MQTT client into MODBUS slave.  This code includes a REGISTER CONFIG option which allows the end user to select the registers to be used while writing and reading data. reg_config is a topic on the mqtt server and is updated every time it is changed. Existing devices register number can be changed or new devices can be added and data written into that register.  This code also includes a SLAVE CONFIG option which allows the end user to assign slave IDs to devices or add new devices with their own slave ID. slave_config is a topic on the mqtt server and is updated every time it is changed. Existing devices slave/unit ID can be changed or new devices can be added.  Hence this implementation allows for the use of multiple MODBUS TCP slaves whose slave IDs can be changed or new slaves added and register number to be used  for each slave can also be configured by the user. Data can be read/written to these slaves from a remote MQTT client connected to iot.eclipse.org MQTT server.
